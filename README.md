# Project to extract color composite video code from **ESP_8_BIT:**

Using mostly the Sega Mega System emulator code path of ESP_8_BIT

Color composite video signal on ESP32 GPIO25

Target plaform: NTSC on ESP32

Not tested: I have no PAL TV, I have no single-core ESP32-S2.

Thanks to *rossumur* who worked out all the color composite video generation
code, providing a foundation for this project.
